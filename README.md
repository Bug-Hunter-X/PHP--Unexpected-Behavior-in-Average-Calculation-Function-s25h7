This repository contains a PHP function designed to compute the average of numbers within an array.  The function demonstrates a common error: division by zero when an empty array is provided.  A solution is also included, which addresses this potential issue by using array_sum and count and handling empty array case. The improved version adds a check to ensure array elements are numeric and outputs an appropriate message for cases that contain non-numeric elements.
